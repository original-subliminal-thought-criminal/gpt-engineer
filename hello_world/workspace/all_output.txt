I apologize for the confusion. Here is the complete implementation of the "Hello, World!" package in Python, following the file syntax:

```main.py
from hello_world import HelloWorld

def main():
    hello_world = HelloWorld()
    hello_world.display()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

```greeting.py
class Greeting:
    def __init__(self, language: str, text: str):
        self.language = language
        self.text = text

    def display(self):
        print(self.text)
```

```hello_world.py
from greeting import Greeting

class HelloWorld(Greeting):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("English", "Hello, World!")
```

Now, the package is complete and functional. The main.py file is the entry point of the program, which imports the HelloWorld class from hello_world.py. The Greeting class is defined in greeting.py, and the HelloWorld class inherits from it. The code in different files is compatible with each other, and all parts of the architecture are present in the files.
