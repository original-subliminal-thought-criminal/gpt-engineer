It should display the message \"Hello, World!\" when executed. The package should be modular and easily extendable to support different greeting messages and languages in the future.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Display the message \"Hello, World!\" when executed.\n2. Modular design to support different greeting messages and languages in the future.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n1. Greeting class (greeting.py)\n   - Purpose: Represents a greeting message with a specific language and text.\n   - Methods:\n     - __init__(self, language: str, text: str): Constructor to initialize the greeting object with a language and text.\n     - display(self): Method to display the greeting message.\n\n2. HelloWorld class (hello_world.py)\n   - Purpose: Represents the \"Hello, World!\" message and inherits from the Greeting class.\n   - Methods:\n     - __init__(self): Constructor to initialize the \"Hello, World!\" message with the default language (English) and text (\"Hello, World!\").\n\n3. main function (main.py)\n   - Purpose: Entry point of the program that creates a HelloWorld object and displays the message.\n   - Functions:\n     - main(): Function to create a HelloWorld object and call its display method.\n\nNon-standard Dependencies:\nNone. The program uses only standard Python libraries."}]
