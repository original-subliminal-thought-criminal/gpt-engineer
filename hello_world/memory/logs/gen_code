It should display the message \"Hello, World!\" when executed. The package should be modular and easily extendable to support different greeting messages and languages in the future.\n\nFeatures:\n1. Display the message \"Hello, World!\" when executed.\n2. Modular design to support different greeting messages and languages in the future.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n1. Greeting class (greeting.py)\n   - Purpose: Represents a greeting message with a specific language and text.\n   - Methods:\n     - __init__(self, language: str, text: str): Constructor to initialize the greeting object with a language and text.\n     - display(self): Method to display the greeting message.\n\n2. HelloWorld class (hello_world.py)\n   - Purpose: Represents the \"Hello, World!\" message and inherits from the Greeting class.\n   - Methods:\n     - __init__(self): Constructor to initialize the \"Hello, World!\" message with the default language (English) and text (\"Hello, World!\").\n\n3. main function (main.py)\n   - Purpose: Entry point of the program that creates a HelloWorld object and displays the message.\n   - Functions:\n     - main(): Function to create a HelloWorld object and call its display method.\n\nNon-standard Dependencies:\nNone. The program uses only standard Python libraries."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Unit tests:\n\nTo generate tests based on the above specification, we will use the pytest library. We will create a test file for each class and function in the specification.\n\n1. Test for Greeting class (test_greeting.py)\n   - Test the constructor and display method.\n\n2. Test for HelloWorld class (test_hello_world.py)\n   - Test the constructor and display method.\n\n3. Test for main function (test_main.py)\n   - Test the main function execution.\n\nHere are the test files:\n\n```test_greeting.py\nimport pytest\nfrom greeting import Greeting\n\ndef test_greeting_constructor():\n    greeting = Greeting(\"English\", \"Hello, World!\")\n    assert greeting.language == \"English\"\n    assert greeting.text == \"Hello, World!\"\n\ndef test_greeting_display(capsys):\n    greeting = Greeting(\"English\", \"Hello, World!\")\n    greeting.display()\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert captured.out == \"Hello, World!\\n\"\n```\n\n```test_hello_world.py\nimport pytest\nfrom hello_world import HelloWorld\n\ndef test_hello_world_constructor():\n    hello_world = HelloWorld()\n    assert hello_world.language == \"English\"\n    assert hello_world.text == \"Hello, World!\"\n\ndef test_hello_world_display(capsys):\n    hello_world = HelloWorld()\n    hello_world.display()\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert captured.out == \"Hello, World!\\n\"\n```\n\n```test_main.py\nimport pytest\nfrom main import main\n\ndef test_main_execution(capsys):\n    main()\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert captured.out == \"Hello, World!\\n\"\n```\n\nThese tests cover the functionality described in the specification.
