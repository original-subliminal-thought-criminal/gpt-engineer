Please write a python module which acts as a wrapper to masscan. It should be able to use all of the major masscan features such as setting rate, exclusion file, hello-string, and various outputs. This module should be installable and come with a readme documenting how to install it, how to use it, and marking that it is a module made by "Darpanet". Please be sure to include flake8 and make the code pep compliant. All functions should have descriptive docstrings. Please also create a professional file structure for the module.
